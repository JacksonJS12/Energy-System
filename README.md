# Energy System Project #

## Overview ##

The Energy System project is a web-based platform for intelligent energy management. It optimizes electricity costs by charging a battery during off-peak hours (when electricity is cheaper) and using the stored energy during peak hours (when prices are higher). The platform automates energy management, provides real-time monitoring, and reduces manual intervention, ensuring cost savings and improved energy efficiency.

## Key Concepts ##

- Intelligent Energy Management

- The system uses real-time electricity prices to determine optimal battery usage.

- Automates the process of charging during low-cost periods and discharging during high-cost periods.

## Modular Design

- Services Layer: Contains business logic.

- Data Layer: Manages persistence.

- Web Layer: Handles user interactions.
